# cytubeanimationtbn
Very simple new feature for cytube channel (chat with synchronized video) where I spend time with friends. It adds a new button that makes things go bouncy when clicked. Code consists of two, general use, functions that make creating and appending other elements simple for less tech savvy people. Rest of code generates this specific button, appends it, and adds onclick handlers.
